# Quantum Cryptanalysis On QKD Protocols and Eveâ€™s Attacks

## Overview

The key distinction of quantum cryptography lies in its use of quantum particles, such as photons, to encode and transmit information. Quantum cryptography is a method of encryption that uses the naturally occurring properties of quantum mechanics to secure and transmit data in a way that cannot be hacked.
